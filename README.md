This repository contains my experimentation with multiprocessing in Python. Some useful resources I have referenced:
* ["Modern Parallel and Distributed Python: A Quick Tutorial on Ray" by Robert Nishihara](https://towardsdatascience.com/modern-parallel-and-distributed-python-a-quick-tutorial-on-ray-99f8d70369b8)
* ["Ray" Python package](https://www.ray.io/)
